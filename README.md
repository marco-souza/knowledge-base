tags: getting-started

This page is basicly some notes, examples and best practices about tools, frameworks, libraries and languages that I've studied. Maybe some notes can be usefull to you. ðŸ˜‰

The topics are ordered by area, like **Front-end**, **Back-end**, **DevOps**, and so on.

Also I've used **tags** to specify tools each post is using. It can be used to find related posts
